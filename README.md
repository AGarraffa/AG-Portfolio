## Alfred Garraffa - Porfolio

This is an early project building out a webpage using HTML and CSS to create a reasonable portolio page. It will continue to be updated with updated projects and assignments that reflect my work as well as updated with improved coding techniques. 

The page is deployed at https://agarraffa.github.io/AG-portfolio/
